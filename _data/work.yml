  value: "At PIXI* SOFTWARE I was a part of an internal \"startup\" team, which had a
          goal to migrate a desktop application to a web application.
          This product was meant for companies that primarily do business on eBay,
          Amazon, Otto, Zalando,etc.
          The application was basically an automation for orders(from ordering to
          sending),
          it also has logistics management, warehouse optimisation, stock management,
          order tracking and much more.
          The product that we started migrating is around 10 years old which meant
          that there was a lot of work to be done.
          In time this team grew so much that we had to split it in two. That's when I
          became a team leader of one of the two teams."
