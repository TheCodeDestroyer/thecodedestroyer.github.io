- title: "Coding"
  value: "Like I stated above a huge part of my life is coding, when I was young(er) I
          found myself doing many different jobs
          like working in factories, fast food delivery, working on a radio station,
          working in a kitchen, working on roofs to name but a few.
          Then I became a developer and I fell in love with my job, it's where I enjoyed
          myself and didn't become bored of it.
          I try to be a hipster, which means that I try to follow all news about new
          libraries and frameworks and then try them out."
- title: "Blogging"
  value: "Like my love for finding out new things and trying them out. I also love to share
          my acquired knowledge.
          Don't get me wrong I'm no expert in writing blogs, I just recently decided that
          I would like to share my thoughts and
          findings on blogs and social media."
- title: "Sports"
  value: "I was always interested in different sports I also trained in many like handball,
          football, indoor climbing, basketball, volleyball, hockey (I could probably find a few more!).
          After workI like to get some fresh oxygen to my brain which means I go for a run
          or jump on a bicycle.
          Sometimes I take my dog and go rollerblading. At the weekend I like to relax by
          going into nature, on a road trip or going hiking."
- title: "Games"
  value: "From time time I also like to shut my brain off by playing some video games. I
          love adventure, action, strategy or RPG games.
          I guess my favorite games that I play the most are MineCraft, League of Legends,
          Team Fortress 2 and Hearthstone.
          I also love playing board games like Pictionary, Activity, Monopoly, etc."
- title: "Books"
  value: "I always loved to read books but lately I haven't had much time to read with all
          the activities I have in my weekly routine.
          Usually I read when I go on vacation. I love psychological, fictional and
          sometimes horror books."
